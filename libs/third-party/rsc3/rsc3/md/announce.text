rsc is a module that specializes the PLT Scheme environment for
working with the SuperCollider synthesis server.

James McCartney's famous Analog Bubbles example is written:

(CombN.ar
 (SinOsc.ar
  (MIDICPS
   (LFSaw.kr 0.4 0 24 (LFSaw.kr '(8 7.23) 0 3 80))) 0 0.1) 0.2 0.2 4)

rsc requires SuperCollider and PLT.  RSC includes an Emacs mode to
provide a functional work environment.  RSC runs on Linux and OSX.

[rsc3](http://rohandrape.net/?t=rsc3) is an
[r6rs](http://r6rs.org/)
scheme module for working with the
[supercollider](http://audiosynth.com/)
synthesiser.
the rsc3 interaction environment
([rsc3.el](?t=rsc3&e=emacs/rsc3.el))
is written for
gnu [emacs](http://gnu.org/software/emacs/).

for installation and configuration please consult the
[tutorial](?t=rsc3-texts&e=lss/rsc3-tutorial.lss)

- [rsc3-dot](?t=rsc3-dot): ugen graph drawing
- [rsc3-disassembler](?t=rsc3-disassembler): synth graph disassembler
- [rsc3-lang](?t=rsc3-lang): supercollider language variants
- [rsc3-midi](?t=rsc3-midi): musical instrument digital interface
- [rsc3-sdif](?t=rsc3-sdif): sound description interchange format
- [hsc3-lisp](?t=hsc3-lisp): a lisp interpeter, sc3 ugens are the only type

there is a small set of example [graphs](?t=rsc3&e=md/graphs.md).
these mostly are written to also work with `hsc3-lisp`,
